    <h1>Maddie Gannon's Biography</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Maddie! I’m a rising sophomore from South Florida.
    </p> 
    <p>I decided to take this class because I’m very interested in technology and computer science, plus I haven’t learned much about data and artificial intelligence, so this class sounded like a great opportunity to expand my knowledge on those topics!
    </p>
    <p>I’ve done a bit of basic front-end development with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I also code with C in my robotics class at school, my most recent project being a prototype surgical arm and claw with an included endoscope.
    </p> 
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Outside of school, I love playing video games. Not really into competitive games, I’ve always a <strong>big</strong> Minecraft enthusiast, so I’m more into relaxed games to just have fun with my friends.
    </p> 
    <p>I look forward to learning a lot while having fun and meeting new people!
    </p>
