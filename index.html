    Hi, I’m Maddie! I’m a rising sophomore from South Florida. I decided to take this class because I’m very interested in technology and computer science, plus I haven’t learned much about data and artificial intelligence, so this class sounded like a great opportunity to expand my knowledge on those topics! I’ve done a bit of basic front-end development with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I also code with C in my robotics class at school, my most recent project being a prototype surgical arm and claw with an included endoscope. Outside of school, I love playing video games. Not really into competitive games, I’ve always a big Minecraft enthusiast, so I’m more into relaxed games to just have fun with my friends. I look forward to learning a lot while having fun and meeting new people!
