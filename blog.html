<h2>Cryptology Blog - Elizabeth Smith Friedman</h2>
<p>Madeline Gannon / July 19th, 2022</p>
<p>
    Elizabeth Smith Friedman was born in 1892. In her early years, she was enjoyed Shakespeare’s work, which later on may have led to her working the Newberry Research Library. It was known for original Shakespeare folio, perhaps piquing her interest  and persuading her to work there. While working at Newberry, Colonel George Fabyan, a wealthy businessman, recruited her to work on his estate. Elizabeth was told that she would be joining a staff of typists and translators in an attempt to prove that Francis Bacon wrote Shakespeare’s plays using a cipher. In 1923, Elizabeth Friedman was hired as a cryptanalyst for the United States Navy. She subsequently held positions with the United States Treasury Department’s Bureau of Prohibition and Bureau of Customs. She accomplished much during her career, utilizing cryptology against international smugglers and drug runners that used encoded messages. Additionally, once they were retired, Elizabeth and her husband wrote a book covering the Shakespearean ciphers, which won several awards from the Folger Shakespeare Library and the American Shakespeare Theater and Academy. One of Mrs. Friedman’s most significant accomplishments was analyzing and solving encoded material about naval vessel movements in Pearl Harbor from one of the espionage’s spies. This contribution from Mrs. Friedman resulted in a guilty verdict against the spy. Elizabeth Smith Friedman passed away on October 31st, 1980. She was truly a pioneer in cryptology, accomplishing great things whilst also being a trailblazer and inspiration for women in the field.
